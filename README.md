# Herediscope

Herediscope is a project done by four Washington University in St. Louis students at the ArchHacks hackathon. Team members include Hyunrae Kim, David Chong, Jon Yue, and me.

Our group created an iOS app that ask users questions to predict their possibility of getting certain hereditary diseases or whether their children in future will have certain diseases or traits.

Our members used simple Mendelian genetics to calculate the possibilities. After few questions, the app presents a possible percentage of obtaining those traits or diseases.
